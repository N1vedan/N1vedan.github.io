I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favourite labs from CPSC-120L Labs

Lab 2, Part 1

This was a great starting lab, as it went over the concept of strings. It was great to learn about how the extraction operator and insertion operator can play an important role in prompting the computer user to write commands and signal the end of a command. Strings is a very strong and foundational topic that I believe most should begin with initially, as it will help with formatting and avoid whitespaces and errors in software.

Lab 4, Part 2

The second part of the lab went over a game called the “Hi-Lo Guessing Game”, where we had to implement an algorithm where you have to guess a ‘secret number’ the program had, and use trial and error to guess the number through prompts such as “too low”, or “too high”. This program involved a lot of if and else statements, using the process of elimination to make this game more fun.

Lab 6, Part 1

This lab went over the idea of Mad Libs, a word game that involved a sentence with blanks. Utilizing our creativity, we could create words to make up a sentence - in which we used the sentence of the contents of a sandwich. Additionally, we used input validation to check if the application met the required criteria in supplying the correct amount of arguments required for that sentence. I loved it because it taught me how our program followed a pattern essential to the command-line arguments, and wrote out a sentence describing an order for that sandwich as an output.
